#Pub Crawl App

For my project I made an app that finds a number of Pubs on a route your taking.
you get to select your destination and the number of pubs you want to visit.

My initial idea was incredibly different to this it was a Photographic app that allows you to log information about camera settings and allows you to pin where you took the photo. I was quite comfortable with that idea so I wanted to try something I wasnt comfortable in so I could try and learn things involving a different subject.

it was quite a tough project

was comfotable with basic tasks

and setting up a basic app,

when I wanted to add more functionality, google places and mongoose 2d to try and connect the pubs i started getting lost and had help from alex putting together.

I tried following along and picked up on one or two things but when i look back at the code im lost,

I would like to add more functionality to the app as in being able to remove pubs from the list so so you can pick which pubs you want and dont want to go to

and a function that once you have visited all the pubs if you want to add more your screen starts shaking so that you moderate tthe amount you drink

and possibly a timer so it gives you a set time per pub so you get to all the pubs and your final location in time ect..
but adding functionality and adding more things to maps made it incredibly difficult



 this project covers - AJAX, Node, Express, SCSS, Gulp, ES6, Google Maps, Databases, NoSQL (Mongo), ORMS (Mongoose), REST & MVC & CSS Frameworks! Despite all of these new concepts... you were also practising your JS, planning and problem solving that you learnt in Unit 1.
