Pub Crawl App

Try it here: https://pubbing.herokuapp.com/

For my second project I made a pub crawl app where a user can enter thier destination and give a number of pubs they would like to visit. The app then calculates the route from your current location and gives you a selection of pubs to visit along the way.

This again was a big leap from project 1 as we learned many new tech, packages and concepts.
Having had a lot of practice I felt fairly confident setting up the app and getting the map to display.

This Project uses a basic authntication system which was built from scratch. I found this part of the porject a little frustrating and complicated. Following detailed instrunctions helped me figure out how to get it to work.

The Google Maps API was a lot of fun to use although APIs were a new concept for me, I found them a little challenging to use so I seeded all the pubs in the App manually. When I feel more comfortable I would like to find an API for the pubs as there are only 40 in the entire app.

I found trying to add more functionality to the app very complicated as I wasn't entierly sure about what to search for.
With help from my teacher Alex I learnt how powerful APIs can be.

As well as trying to find an API for the pubs I also have a few more ideas for the App which I will work on at a later point.

I Think being able to pick and remove pubs from the list would be a handy new feature I would like to work on so you can choose pubs incase you want to avoid some, as well as a timer so you can get your destination on time and visit all the pubs on the way. 

Another idea is when the user has visited all the pubs and they want to visit more the app sends a message: "Burger Time!" or if you are incredibly persistant the screen starts shaking so that you can take things easy.


This project used the following tech: AJAX, Node, Express, SCSS, Gulp, ES6, Google Maps, Databases, NoSQL (Mongo), ORMS (Mongoose), REST & MVC & CSS Frameworks 

Despite all of these new concepts we also practiced planning and problem solving and Javascript that we learnt in Project 1.

This again was a complicated project but I feel like I have developed and progressed a lot since the start of the course.
